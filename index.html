    <h1>Windows 95 Virtual Machine and Memories</h1>
    <p class="first mt-4">
      Oh, to be a 90s kid. The Windows 95 operating system (os) was a life-changing 
      experience for many of us. I loved the Windows 95 os, which was a huge and special 
      part of my formative years. In recent years I've been tempted to snag an original 
      machine again. However, virtual machines (VM) have also intrigued me. 
    </p>
    <h2>What is a Virtual Machine?</h2>
    <p>A VM is an emulation of an actual computer. There isn't a tangible physical 
      computer; it is an entirely software-defined system. I run my Windows 95 off my main 
      Windows 10 rig. So, my Windows 95 computer exists inside my Windows 10 computer! My 
      Windows 95 exists purely as code and runs independently from my Windows 10. My VM is
      partitioned on my rig's hard drive and therefore does not interfere with my host 
      machine running Windows 10. I've had fun building other VMs. I have one running 
      Ubuntu, and I'm considering trying my hand at a Linux Mint VM. Thanks to the 
      partitions, there isn't ever any interference.</p>
      <h2>Why do people make Virtual Machines?</h2>
      <p>Part of my reasons for not snagging an old-school Windows 95 is that my house 
      only has so much physical space, which is why companies use virtual machines. 
      Reducing physical space and hardware can equal cost savings in the real world. If 
      you find this intriguing and want more information on virtual machines, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-virtual-machine/" target="_blank">Microsoft 
      has an overview of the subject.</a> Microsoft listed five reasons people use VMs which 
      are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cost savings</strong>—running multiple virtual environments from one piece of 
          infrastructure means that you can drastically reduce your physical 
          infrastructure footprint. This boosts your bottom line—decreasing the need to 
          maintain nearly as many servers and saving on maintenance costs and 
          electricity.</li>
        <li><strong>Agility and speed</strong>—Spinning up a VM is relatively easy and quick and is much 
          simpler than provisioning an entire new environment for your developers. 
          Virtualization makes the process of running dev-test scenarios a lot quicker.</li>
        <li><strong>Lowered downtime</strong>—VMs are so portable and easy to move from one hypervisor to another on a different machine—this means that they are a great solution for backup, in the event the host goes down unexpectedly.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability</strong>—VMs allow you to more easily scale your apps by adding more physical or virtual servers to distribute the workload across multiple VMs. As a result you can increase the availability and performance of your apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Security benefits</strong>— Because virtual machines run in multiple operating systems, using a guest operating system on a VM allows you to run apps of questionable security and protects your host operating system. VMs also allow for better security forensics, and are often used to safely study computer viruses, isolating the viruses to avoid risking their host computer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Nostalgia</h2>
      <p>A reason not listed in Microsoft's above five points is nostalgia. When I found 
        fellow techies making VMs, I found many were making a VM for a beloved childhood 
        OS. This was mine. I really enjoyed learning how to make VMs and have made more 
        since. Also, I saw other people who loved learning about computers and seeing how 
        far they have improved over the decades. Anytime I go back to an old OS, I have 
        to approach it differently than a modern, more intuitive one.</p>
        <h2>Try a VM!</h2>
        <p>If you want a fun weekend project and a chance to try your hand at something 
          new, try making a VM. Making a VM is a valuable tool to have in the tech person's 
          toolbox. What you'll want to do is get <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Oracle VM VirtualBox</a>. It is an open-source 
          program free to download. Internet Archive has been a valuable resource for files 
          like nabbing old operating systems. See if you can get some current video tutorials 
          on YouTube. <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/329301/how-to-install-windows-95-in-a-virtual-machine/" target="_blank">This How to Geek tutorial is pretty good.</a> You're going to need a 
          Windows 95 iso file from <a href="https://archive.org/search?query=windows+95+2.5" target="_blank">the internet archive</a>. An iso file is an image of the 
          operating system. Try to find an OSR version 2.5 when looking for your image 
          file. No matter what you download 111-1111111 will be a valid product key. If you want to hear why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwyH59nACzQ" target="_blank">this video is rad.</a></p>
          <p>What made it frustrating for me was a lot of tutorials failed to say you're 
            going to need one more file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/fix-95-cpu" target="_blank">This file is the fix 95 CPU file.</a> Old CPUs ran 
            at slower speeds than whatever you have currently. This file makes running 
            Windows 95 on your modern CPU possible. Many tutorials left this nugget out, 
            so it took me all weekend, a bunch of coffee, candy, and scouring the internet 
            to solve it. I wasn't going to stop until I solved this. After discovering this 
            file, I ran wild in my old os and relived all my fond memories in no time. 
            You can keep searching around the internet archive to find files of the games 
            you liked. </p>
          <p class="final mb-5">Final tip: I'm going to say stay organized with all your files for this 
            project. I have on my Windows 10 desktop a folder titled Win95. I've kept all 
            my files halfway organized should anything ever go awry. Also, I keep my 
            virtual software disks in there. Should I want to play Spider-Man Cartoon 
            Maker, I put the virtual disk in the virtual drive and launch the program. If I
            had my files kicking in different places, playing the games I love wouldn't be 
            easy. Make dedicated folders for whatever operating systems you're playing with,
            and keep your files for that OS all in one place. I do the same for Linux Ubuntu.</p>

                Before Microsoft Office, there was Microsoft Works. Many of us
                used it for our school projects. I also used it to play fancy
                luncheon as a kid and print menus. Those grilled cheese

                very 80s dishes.
